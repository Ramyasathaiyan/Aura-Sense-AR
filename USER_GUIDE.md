# 📘 AuraSense AR: End-User Guide

Welcome to **AuraSense AR**. This guide will help you understand how to install, calibrate, and use the application to navigate your environment safely.

## 1. Quick Start Guide
To begin using AuraSense AR, follow these three steps:

1. **Launch:** Open the app and grant **Camera** and **Microphone** permissions.
2. **Calibrate:** Hold the phone at chest height. Move it slowly in a small circle to allow the sensors to "see" the floor and walls.
3. **Navigate:** Once you hear a low-frequency hum, the app is tracking. Walk slowly and listen for changes in the sound.

## 2. Understanding the Feedback

The app communicates through **Sound** and **Touch**. You do not need to look at the screen to navigate.

### 🔊 Audio Sonar (The "Beeps")
The app acts like a submarine sonar. 
* **Clear Path:** A slow, low-pitched sound means there are no obstacles within 3 meters.
* **Approaching Obstacle:** As you get closer to a wall or furniture, the sound will become **higher in pitch** and **faster**.
* **Immediate Danger:** A very sharp, rapid beeping means you are about to touch an object.

### 📳 Haptic Alerts (Vibration)
When you are within **0.5 meters** (roughly arm's length) of an obstacle, the phone will **vibrate continuously**. 
> **Note:** If you feel the vibration, stop immediately and use your hand or a cane to identify the object.

## 3. Using the Interface

The app features two main "Smart" buttons designed for accessibility:

| Feature | Button | What it does |
| :--- | :--- | :--- |
| **Voice Status** | **Speaker Icon** | Tapping this triggers the **Text-to-Speech** engine. The app will say: *"Object detected at 1.5 meters."* |
| **Voice Commands** | **Microphone Icon** | Hold this button and speak. You can say **"Status"** to hear your current distance or **"Stop"** to pause the app. |

## 4. Tips for Success

* **Lighting:** The app works best in well-lit rooms. It may not detect obstacles in total darkness.
* **Surface Types:** Very shiny surfaces (like glass doors) or very dark carpets can be hard for the AR sensors to see. 
* **Phone Grip:** Hold your phone firmly. If you drop the phone or move it too fast, the tracking may "drift." Use the **Reset** button to fix this.

## 5. Safety Disclaimer
**⚠️ IMPORTANT:** AuraSense AR is an **assistive tool** only. It is intended to provide extra information about your surroundings. **Never** use this app as a total replacement for a white cane, a guide dog, or a human sighted guide.

## 6. Support

1. Ensure your **Media Volume** is turned up.
2. Check that your phone is not in "Do Not Disturb" or "Silent" mode.
3. Restart the app to recalibrate the sensors.
