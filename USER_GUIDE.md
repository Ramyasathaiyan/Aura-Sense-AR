# AuraSense AR: User Manual & Safety Guide 🛰️

## 1. Introduction
AuraSense AR is an assistive navigation tool. It uses your phone's camera and sensors to detect obstacles and converts that data into sound and vibrations.

## 2. Setting Up
1. **Device:** Ensure you are using an ARCore-supported Android device.
2. **Lighting:** The app requires visible light to "see" surfaces. It may not work in total darkness.
3. **Permissions:** When prompted, allow **Camera** and **Microphone** access.

## 3. How to Use
- **Holding the Phone:** Hold the phone vertically at chest height, pointing forward.
- **Interpreting Sound (Sonar):**
    - **Low Pitch:** Obstacle is far away (over 2 meters).
    - **High Pitch:** Obstacle is close (less than 1 meter).
    - **Rapid Beeping:** You are very close to an object.
- **Haptics:** The phone will vibrate continuously if you are within 0.5 meters of a wall or object.

## 4. Safety Warnings ⚠️
- **DO NOT** use this as your primary navigation tool. 
- Always use a white cane or a guide dog in unfamiliar environments.
- Be aware of drop-offs like stairs, as AR may not detect floor-level changes instantly.
